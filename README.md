# Flappy Puncher

[Play Flappy Puncher](https://dani-dev28.github.io/JS-GameFlappyPuncher/)

The polish end goal for *Flappy Puncher* is to produce a web-based version of **Muse Dash**, except with some twist of **Jet Back Runner**.

For the current crude iteration, the focus is on basic movement, collision, and scoring mechanics.

## Controls

- **Jump** - `Space`
- **Fall Down Faster** - `E`

## Unimplemented Controls

- **Left/Right** - `W` / `F`
- **Punch** - `J`
- **Special** - `I`
